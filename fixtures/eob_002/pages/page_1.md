A dentist may not bill or collect from a member any charges in connection with a non-covered dental service unless an executed financial responsibility form has been obtained from the member or the member's legal representative prior to performing the services.

Have you advised your patient about reasonable post-surgical pain expectations and management?

In the management of post-surgical discomfort, the use of non-opioid pain relievers may be sufficient.

Consider the use of short duration opioid prescriptions when there is a need to manage pain relief for a limited time basis.

According to the Center for Disease Control and prevention in 2016, 42,249 people died from an opioid overdose.

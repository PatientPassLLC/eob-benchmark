Reminder: A coverage determination, prior authorization, or certification that is made prior to a service being performed is not a promise to pay for the service at any particular rate or amount. The patient's summary plan description typically governs this, as every claim submitted is subject to all plan provisions, including, but not limited to, eligibility requirements, exclusions, limitations, and applicable state mandates.

If you'd like information on how much the customer has met towards their accumulators (e.g., deductibles), please visit our website at cignaforhcp.com or contact Customer Service.

**Notes:**
HAD - Thank you for using a Total Dental Administrators contracted healthcare professional. The amount eligible for coverage is determined by the Cigna Dental Savings Program. The difference between the submitted charges and the negotiated amount and the customer's benefit plan. The difference between the submitted charges and the negotiated amount is not the patient's responsibility.
HAG - Thank you for using the Cigna Dental Savings Program. The amount eligible for coverage is determined by the Cigna Dental negotiated amount and the customer's benefit plan. The difference between the submitted charges and the negotiated amount is not the patient's responsibility.
L26 - YOUR PLAN LIMITS COVERAGE TO ONCE FOR EACH TOOTH EVERY 3 YEARS.
